4. Click "Apply".

### Exporting Blocked Emails

3. Select a CSV file containing email addresses to block.
4. Click the "Import Blocked Emails" button.

Note: The CSV file should have a header row with "Blocked Emails" as the column name. The import function will skip this header row.

### Debug Mode

You can enable debug mode in two ways:

1. Check the "Debug Mode" box in the plugin settings.

   ```php
   define('WP_USER_BLOCKING_DEBUG', true);
   ```

   This will override the setting in the admin panel.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will this plugin block existing logged-in users?**
A: Yes, the plugin checks user access on each page load, so it will block existing sessions for newly blocked users.

**Q: Can I block entire IP ranges?**
A: Currently, the plugin only supports blocking individual IP addresses. IP range blocking may be added in future updates.

**Q: What happens if I block my own email or IP?**
A: If you block your own email or IP, you may lose access to your site. Always keep debug mode on or have an alternate admin account when testing.

**Q: How do I unblock a user?**
A: You can unblock a user by removing their email from the Blocked Emails list in the plugin settings, or by using the "Unblock User" action on the Users page.
